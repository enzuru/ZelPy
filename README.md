# ZelPy

This is a "work in progress" SNES-style MOBA in [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/) and [Pykka](https://www.pykka.org/en/latest/).

I implement the actor-based single-threaded model of multiplayer game engine design as described in these books: https://leanpub.com/u/nobugs

Installation and use instructions will eventually be updated here as the project matures.

For now, dive into the client code at [client/client.py](client/client.py) and the server code at [server/server.py](server/server.py).
